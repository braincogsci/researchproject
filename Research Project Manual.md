# Research Project Manual
Introduction

This manual concerns the modules

Research Project 1

and

Research Project 2

for

students

from

the master

programme

Brain and Cognitive Sciences

at the University of Amsterdam

(UvA)

. It was written to inform all

involved parties

about the requi

rements of the research project and

about

their

role, whether student,

daily

supervisor,

examiner or co

-assessor

.

The research project

is one of the capstones

of our program

me, in which students acquir

e practical research

experience and

learn to work and think independently

within a scientific

environment

. During th

e research

project, the student is trained to:

1.

Engage in

the different phases of research in the field of b

rain and c

ognitive

sciences

(e.g. using

and

select

ing

relevant

literature, choosing a

research design, performing

experimental work,

analyzing

data

)

2.

Independently perform relevant scientific res

earch method(s) and data analyse

s

3.

Create a realistic planning for research, within the

time

limits

that are imposed

4.

Write a scientific report about his/her research at an academic level

5.

Demonstrate

academic presentation skills

6.

Demonstrate a scientific attitude (independence, responsibility,

perseverance, initiative, self

-

assessment

, communication) within the

work and in relation to the supervisor and colleagues.

7.

Reflect on and describe the limitatio

ns and implications of the research.

All students of the research master Brain and Cognitive Sciences conduct two research projects as mandatory

parts of their curriculum:

Research Project 1

and

Research Project 2

.

Roles

To reach these goals, the student w

ill work together with a daily supervisor

, a co

-assessor and a (UvA

-based)

examiner

.The daily supervisor can be a PhD candidate or a more senior researcher who works in the hosting

research group.

One of the other two roles

(co

-assessor or examiner

) should be a senior researcher

in that

research group

. The other role

(examiner or co

-assessor

) should be a researcher from another research

group who still has relevant expertise to assess the student’s research project repor

t. Note that

the

examiner

needs

be permanent staff at the University of Amsterdam (UvA)

, as only UvA staff can register the student’s

grade.

Table 1

summarizes

the requirements and responsibilities of the

different roles.

Please note that the tasks

for both examiner and co

-assessor are dependent on whether they are internal or external to the lab where

the project is taking place. The tasks are described in more detail in the next section.
