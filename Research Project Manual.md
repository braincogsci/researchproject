# Research Project Manual
## Introduction

This manual concerns the modules *Research Project 1* and *Research Project 2* for students from the master programme *Brain and Cognitive Sciences* at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). It was written to inform all involved parties about the requirements of the research project and about their role, whether student, supervisor, assessor or examiner.

The research project is one of the capstones of our programme, in which students acquire practical research experience and learn to work and think independently within a scientific environment. All students of the research master *Brain and Cognitive Sciences* conduct two research projects as mandatory parts of their curriculum:

*Research Project 1* and *Research Project 2*.

## Learning objectives
During the research projects, the student is trained to:

1. Engage in the different phases of research in the field of brain and cognitive sciences (i.e. using and selecting relevant literature, choosing a research design, performing experimental work, analyzing data).

2. Independently perform relevant scientific research method(s) and data analyses.

3. Create a realistic planning for research, within the time limits that are imposed.

4. Write a scientific report about his/her research at an academic level.

5. Demonstrate academic presentation skills.

6. Demonstrate a scientific attitude (independence, responsibility, perseverance, initiative, self-assessment, communication) within the work and in relation to the supervisor and colleagues.

7. Reflect on and describe the limitations and implications of the research project.

## Roles within the project

To reach these goals, the student will work together with a daily supervisor, an internal assessor and an external assessor. 

The daily supervisor can be a PhD candidate or a more senior researcher who works in the hosting research group. The internal assessor should be a researcher within the hosting research group who has a doctoral degree. It is possible for a single person to have both the supervisor and  internal assessor role, as long as these requirements are met.

The external assessor should be a researcher from another group, who still has relevant expertise (whether topic-wise or method-wise) to assess the final report that is written on the project.

One of the assessors will be designated examiner, and will hold ultimate responsibility for the final grade. This examiner needs to be a UvA employee with a doctoral degree.

Table 1 summarizes the requirements and responsibilities of the different roles. Please note that the assessor tasks depend on whether the assessor is internal or external to the lab where the project is taking place. The tasks are described in more detail in the next section.

Role| Requirements| Responsibilities
