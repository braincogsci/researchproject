# Grading Rubrics Research Projects
Here you find the grading rubrics for the three different assessment components of the modules *Research Project 1* and *Research Project 2* in the research master *Brain and Cognitive Sciences*.

As a reminder, the components have designated weights and minimum grades as shown in the following table.

| Component |Contribution to final grade| Graded by| Minimum grade | 
|:--|:--:|:--|:--:|
|Experimental work  |40%  |Internal assessor |5.5 |
|Final report  |50%  |Internal assessor and external assessor |6.0 |
|Oral presentation  |10%  |Internal assessor |5.5 |

To determine the grades for these components, assessors can use the holistic rubrics listed below. Note that the weight of the different columns *within* the rubrics is at the discretion of the assessor. This is done because different projects require different emphases.

## Experimental work (40%)
|Dimension  |Insufficient (5.5 or less) |Sufficient (6.0 - 7.9) |Good (8.0 - 8.9)| Excellent (9.0 or higher)|
|--|--|--- |--- |--- |
|Collecting literature  |  | | | |
|Experimental skills  |  | | | |
|Data analysis  |  | | | |
|Process |  | | | |
|Original contribution|  | | | |
