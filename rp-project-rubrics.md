# Grading Rubrics Research Projects
Here you find the grading rubrics for the three different assessment components of the modules *Research Project 1* and *Research Project 2* in the research master *Brain and Cognitive Sciences*.

As a reminder, the components have designated weights and minimum grades as shown in the following table.

| Component |Contribution to final grade| Graded by| Minimum grade | 
|:--|:--:|:--|:--:|
|Experimental work  |40%  |Internal assessor |5.5 |
|Final report  |50%  |Internal assessor and external assessor |6.0 |
|Oral presentation  |10%  |Internal assessor |5.5 |

To determine the grades for these components, assessors can use the rubrics listed below. Note that the weight of the different rows *within* the rubrics is at the discretion of the assessor. This is done because different projects require different emphases.

# Determining the grades
## Grading scheme
The University of Amsterdam (UvA) uses a grading scheme that ranges from 1.0 to 10. [Here](https://student.uva.nl/en/content/az/grading-scheme/grading-scheme.html) you can find a comparison between the UvA grading scheme and other systems. Interpreted in light of the goals of the research master *Brain and Cognitive Sciences*, we can describe the different grades as follows.


|Grade|Description |
|:-----:|------------------|
|1.0 -- 4.0|The work is not at the level of a master's student and would also not be sufficient for a student at the bachelor's level|
|4.5 -- 5.0|The work is not at the level of a master's student, but would be sufficient for a student at the bachelor's level|
|5.5 -- 6.0|The work is only just sufficient at the level of a master's student.|
|6.5 -- 7.5|The work meets reasonable expectations of a research master's student. |
|8.0 -- 8.5|The work shows that the research master's student is performing at a high level.|
|9.0 -- 9.5|The work demonstrates excellence.|
|10.0|The research master's student is performing at a level appropriate for a PhD student in the first year of their programme, or better. |

# The grading rubrics
## Experimental work (40%)
|Dimension  |Insufficient (5.5 or less) |Sufficient (6.0 - 7.9) |Good (8.0 - 8.9)| Excellent (9.0 or higher)|
|-|----|----|----|----|
|Collecting literature  |The student did not manage to collect appropriate literature for effective performance on the research project and lacks an overview of the theoretical framework in which the research project took place. Because of this important design choices could not be motivated by the student. |The student collected relevant literature, but did not arrive at a demonstrable, full understanding of it and therefore cannot clearly motivate all the important choices relevant to the research question and experimental design. |The student collected and evaluated relevant literature, leading to a good understanding of the theoretical framework and empirical space in which the project took place. The student can motivate the choice of research questions and important design choices.|The student independently collected literature that was relevant for the research project, critically assessed this literature and obtained a strong overview of both the theoretical framework and empirical space in which the research project took place. The student can clearly argue what the value of the research question under consideration is, and can motivate all steps in the experimental design. Moreover, the student is capable of comparing the approach taken within the project with those in peer-reviewed literature.|
|Experimental skills  |Experimental work done by the student is not efficient, either because of low accuracy, low speed or the requirement of intensive supervision. |The student learned to employ the techniques that were necessary to gather data, but there is considerate room for improvement with regards to timeliness/accuracy. |The student worked in a timely and accurate fashion when applying the techniques relevant to this project. The student has a good idea of how the techniques work, but is not yet able to apply them independently or in a novel setting.|The student mastered the techniques that were necessary to gather data and understands their principles and their scope of applicability. The student is able to employ the techniques independently and in novel situations. The student works timely and accurately when doing such experimental work. |
|Data analysis  |The student is not able to select a data analysis method and/or cannot analyze and interpret results without step-by-step supervision.  |The student is able to select an appropriate data analysis for acquired data in the domain of the research project and is also able to analyze and interpret the results, but still requires considerable supervision to do so, and is not capable of motivating important choices during the analysis.|The student is able to select appropriate data analysis methods for acquired data in the domain of the research project. The student has shown a good understanding of the workings of the analysis methods and is able to analyze and interpret results. |The student is able to select appropriate data analysis methods for acquired data in the domain of the research project, and can provide clear argumentation to support a choice. The student is able to perform analysis and interpret the results critically, while relatively unsupervised.|
|Process |The learning process of the student was unnecessarily hindered for a long time and/or the student could not be relied upon when agreements or deadlines were set. Feedback had little effect to improve the learning of the student.|The student stayed in control of the learning process, seeking out information independently or by asking questions. However, the learning process was unnecessarily hindered at times and/or the student had difficulties upholding agreements and deadlines. The student responded well to feedback.| The student showed initiative in learning, seeking out information independently or by asking questions. The student responded well to feedback and upheld agreements and deadlines.|The student has demonstrated to be inquisitive during the learning process, keeping the right balance between asking questions and learning independently. The student upheld agreements and deadlines, responded well to feedback and took initiative to structure the internship, set personal goals and optimize learning.|
|Original contribution| Throughout the project, the student mostly followed instructions with regards to experimental design, data analysis and interpretation. The student did not bring in any substantial ideas for the project.| The student demonstrated the ability to make choices for the experimental design, data analysis and interpretation of results, in collaboration with the supervisor.|The student can formulate good hypotheses and make design choices independently. |The student can formulate good hypotheses and make design choices independently, and can articulate the good reasoning behind those choices. The student came up with original insights or ideas that clearly aided data collection, analysis or interpretation.|
|Collaboration|The student does not clearly keep the larger goal of the group and the objectives of colleagues in mind when working and has failed to consider the tasks and schedules of others on multiple occassions.|The student is clearly aware of the larger goals of the group and of the objectives of colleagues. The student organized his/her work in such a way that it considered those goals and objectives.|The student is clearly aware of the larger goal of the group and the objectives of colleagues. The student organized his/her project work in such a way that it contributed to reaching those goals and objectives.|The student is clearly aware of the larger goals of the group and the objectives of colleagues. The student's work contributed to reaching those goals and objectives not only by working effectively on his/her own project, but also by helping out others and working in the interest of the group as a whole.|

## Presentation (10%)
|Dimension  |Insufficient (5.5 or less) |Sufficient to good (6.0 - 8.9) | Excellent (9.0 or higher)|
|-|----|----|----|
|Structure of the presentation | The structure of the presentation is lacking, because elements are missing or are not connected in a way that facilitates communication.|The presentation deals with the necessary elements (question, methods, results, discussion/conclusion), but the chosen structure is not ideal to convey this information. |The presentation has an engaging opening and then tells a coherent, clear story that explains the research question, research design, results and their discussion and conclusion.

|Clarity of design|There is information missing, too much unnecessary information or the presentation of the design is otherwise not clear.|The presentation contains all necessary information about the goals and the design of the experiment, but (important) choices were left unexplained or were not communicated clearly.|The presentation clearly conveys the design that was used to answer the research question(s). It makes good use of graphs, contains no unnecessary information and is easily readable.|
|Results|The results are not clear from the presentation.|The presentation lists the important results, but the steps that were made to arrive at the results are (partially) omitted or not clearly explained.|The presentation clearly conveys the important results from the project and how they were obtained. Whenever relevant, the presentation addresses the steps of analyses and this explanation is supported through good use of graphs and figures.|
|Discussion|The student is not able to provide satisfactory answers to questions about the research.|The student is able to answer basic questions about aims and design choices, but is not able to critically reflect on the research.|The student is able to engage in a productive, critical discussion about the research project and can aptly respond to questions about it.|
|Eye contact and elocution|The student mumbles or is otherwise difficult to follow, and makes too much use of notes or other supportive material to stay on track.|Student is mostly clear and mostly maintains appropriate eye contact, but makes (too much) use of notes or other supportive material, or at times has trouble expressing ideas.|Student uses a clear voice and correct English, so that everyone can easily follow the presentation. The student maintains appropriate eye contact with the group, while making little use of notes or presentation slides to stay on track.|

## Research report (50%)
Please note that the bandwidths of the categories 'insufficient' and 'sufficient to good' are quite broad and offer room for nuance when determining the actual grades.
