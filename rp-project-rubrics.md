# Grading Rubrics Research Projects
Here you find the grading rubrics for the three different assessment components of the modules *Research Project 1* and *Research Project 2* in the research master *Brain and Cognitive Sciences*.

As a reminder, the components have designated weights and minimum grades as shown in the following table.

| Component |Contribution to final grade| Graded by| Minimum grade | 
|:--|:--:|:--|:--:|
|Experimental work  |40%  |Internal assessor |5.5 |
|Final report  |50%  |Internal assessor and external assessor |6.0 |
|Oral presentation  |10%  |Internal assessor |5.5 |

To determine the grades for these components, assessors can use the holistic rubrics listed below. Note that the weight of the different columns *within* the rubrics is at the discretion of the assessor. This is done because different projects require different emphases.

## Experimental work (40%)
|Dimension  |Insufficient (5.5 or less) |Sufficient (6.0 - 7.9) |Good (8.0 - 8.9)| Excellent (9.0 or higher)|
|-|----|----|----|----|
|Collecting literature  |Despite supervision on this process, the student did not manage to collect appropriate literature for effective performance on the research project. The student lacks an overview of the theoretical framework in which the research project took place, and cannot motivate the important design choices.  |The student collected relevant literature, but did not arrive at a demonstrable understanding of it and cannot motivate all the important choices in the experimental design. |The student collected and evaluated relevant literature, leading to a good understanding of the theoretical framework and empirical space in which the project took place. Student can motivate the choice of research questions and important design choices |The student independently collected literature that was relevant for the research project, critically assessed this literature and obtained a complete overview of both the theoretical framework and empirical space in which the research project took place. The student can now clearly argue what the value of the research question under consideration is, and can motivate all steps in the experimental design |
