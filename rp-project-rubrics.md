# Grading Rubrics Research Projects
Here you find the grading rubrics for the three different assessment components of the modules *Research Project 1* and *Research Project 2* in the research master *Brain and Cognitive Sciences*.

As a reminder, the components have designated weights and minimum grades as shown in the following table.

| Component |Contribution to final grade| Graded by| Minimum grade | 
|:--|:--:|:--|:--:|
|Experimental work  |40%  |Internal assessor |5.5 |
|Final report  |50%  |Internal assessor and external assessor |6.0 |
|Oral presentation  |10%  |Internal assessor |5.5 |

To determine the grades for these components, you can use the holistic rubrics listed below. Holistic rubrics allow you to weigh the different columns of the rubric at your own discretion. This affords the versatility that is necessary for a multidisciplinary pool of students. If you want to learn more about holistic rubrics, see
