# Frequently asked questions

## By students

### I want to register my project, but do not have a proposal yet that I can submit. What should I do?
This is fine. Registration is the first step. It just lets you detail where and with whom you will do your internship. After registration, you can submit your research proposal and you have a month to do so.

### How do I fill in who is examiner and who is assessor on Datanose?
Every Research Project involves two distinct assessors. One of these is the examiner, who should be a senior researcher at the UvA. Datanose wants to see explicitly which of the assessors takes on this role. It is important to consider the following.

* If a project is *internal* (at UvA), the examiner will be assessing all elements (experimental work, presentation and report). Choose the person who has agreed to this, so a senior researcher at the institute where you are working.
* If a project is *external* (to UvA), the examiner will only be the second reader of the final report, who is based at UvA. Please select the person who has agreed to this role.
* Fill in the examiner first.
* In the assessor field, fill in the name of the other assessor. If this assessor is not from UvA, you may need to click the blue box labeled "Not in list" in the dialog that pops up when you enter the name of the assessor.

### I am registering my project on Datanose, but step 2 is missing. Is something wrong?
This is an oddity of the Datanose system. MBCS skips a step that many other educational programmes use during internships, and for some reason our steps cannot be renumbered. You can safely ignore the missing number 2.

### The grading rubric handed to me via the manual is different from the rubrics shown on Datanose. Which one should I use?
Sometimes the grading rubrics tied to a specific project on www.datanose.nl lag behind the rubrics as they were set out in the Research Project Manual. If this is the case, please use the rubrics in the manual to determine the grades per dimension and for the rubrics overall. You can then fill in these grades on Datanose. In the dropdown menu, select the description that is closest to the student performance.
