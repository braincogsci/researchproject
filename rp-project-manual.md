# Research Project Manual

## Introduction

This manual concerns the modules *Research Project 1* and *Research Project 2* for students from the master programme *Brain and Cognitive Sciences* at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). These modules are also known as internships . This manual was written to inform all involved parties about the requirements of the research project and about their role, whether student, supervisor, assessor or examiner.

The research project is one of the capstones of our programme, in which students acquire practical research experience and learn to work and think independently within a scientific environment. All students of the research master *Brain and Cognitive Sciences* conduct two research projects as mandatory parts of their curriculum:

*Research Project 1* (26 or 32 EC) and *Research Project 2* (36 or 42 EC).

---
Note for the reader: students from *Brain and Cognitive Sciences* form a multidisciplinary group and enter internships at a wide range of hosting institutes. Some of them could work at philosophy departments, others might deal with fMRI data analysis and again others would do their work at neurobiology labs. These different hosts will emphasize different skills, but all of them expose the students to the cycle of formulating a research question, gathering data, performing analysis and interpreting results to answer the research question.

## Learning objectives
During the research projects, the student is trained to:

1. Engage in the different phases of research in the field of brain and cognitive sciences (i.e. using and selecting relevant literature, choosing a research design, performing experimental work, analyzing data).

2. Independently perform relevant scientific research method(s) and data analyses.

3. Create a realistic planning for research, within the time limits that are imposed.

4. Write a scientific report about his/her research at an academic level.

5. Demonstrate academic presentation skills.

6. Demonstrate a scientific attitude (independence, responsibility, perseverance, initiative, self-assessment, communication) within the work and in relation to the supervisor and colleagues.

7. Reflect on and describe the limitations and implications of the research project.

## Roles within the project

To reach these goals, the student will work together with a daily supervisor, an internal assessor and an external assessor. 

The daily supervisor can be a PhD candidate or a more senior researcher who works in the hosting research group. The internal assessor should be a researcher within the hosting research group who has a doctoral degree. It is possible for a single person to have both the supervisor and  internal assessor role, as long as these requirements are met.

The external assessor should be a researcher from another group, who still has relevant expertise (whether topic-wise or method-wise) to assess the final report that is written on the project.

One of the assessors will be designated examiner, and will hold ultimate responsibility for the final grade. This examiner needs to be a UvA employee with a doctoral degree.

Table 1 summarizes the requirements and responsibilities of the different roles. Please note that the assessor tasks depend on whether the assessor is internal or external to the lab where the project is taking place. The tasks are described in more detail in the section [Detailed tasks per role](#detailed-tasks-per-role).

## Phases of the Research Project

The Research Project goes through several phases:

1. In the first month, the student registers the Research Project via www.datanose.nl/#yourprojects, reads relevant literature and formulates research questions, hypotheses and an appropriate design. This results in a Research Proposal, which the students submits via the online form at Datanose.nl within one month of registering  the project.

2. In the subsequent months, the student will acquire and/or analyze the data relevant to the Research Project. At some convenient time within this phase, the student will have a Midterm Evaluation to discuss progress and mutual satisfaction of the student and supervisor.
3. In the final month of the project (or earlier if the supervisor deems this appropriate), the student will draft a report on the conducted research, on which the supervisor provides feedback. This draft should be as definitive as possible, so that meaningful feedback can be given.

Based on the feedback on this draft, the student will submit a final version to Datanose.nl, which will be graded by both assessors. 

The student will also give an oral presentation about their Research Project, during a meeting at which at least the internal assessor is present, but preferably in front of the research group.

## Detailed tasks per role
### Supervisor tasks

#### Assists in creating realistic project planning, corresponding to workload.
When the student submits a research proposal to the programme, this will include planning for the project. This planning should be realistic and the workload should correspond to the EC coun
#### Contact person for student questions.
The supervisor is the go-to person for the student, for any question related to performing the research project. During the research project, the supervisor should be available to discuss problems within a reasonable timeframe. When absent due to illness or leave, the supervisor should ensure that there is somebody else available for pressing questions of the student.
####  Helps with learning techniques, understanding relevant concepts.
The daily supervisor guides the student and provides constructive feedback on his or her performance. This feedback is important to improve skills and knowledge of the student, but also to foster an overall academic attitude. 
#### Provides feedback on overall performance and promotes scientific attitude.
#### Joins midterm evaluation, together with student.
#### Provides feedback on the draft version of the research report.
####  Evaluates experimental work and presentation: advises internal assessor on grading



The intensity of supervision varies between projects, so it is important that this is discussed prior to the start of the research project, so that the student knows what to expect.
.

At the start of the project, the student is responsible for submitting a Research Proposal to the masterâ€™s

programme. This proposal serves to prepare the student for the work ahead, but also to ensure that planning

is realis

tic. As a supervisor,

please check whether the workload of the project is feasible

(do to so, you can

take the amount of EC for the project and multiply it by 28, which gives the amount of hours that should be

spent on the project).

### Student tasks
As a research master student, the student enrolled in either *Research Project 1* or *Research Project 2* is expected to take the lead on his or her project. While all decisions and plan should be made in collaboration with the supervisor, the student is expected to display ownership of the project. Expectations from the student are summarized in [table 2](#responsibilities-of-the-student).
