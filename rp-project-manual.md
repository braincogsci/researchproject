# Research Project Manual

## Introduction

This manual concerns the modules *Research Project 1* and *Research Project 2* for students from the master programme *Brain and Cognitive Sciences* at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). These modules are also known as internships . This manual was written to inform all involved parties about the requirements of the research project and about their role, whether student, supervisor, assessor or examiner.

The research project is one of the capstones of our programme, in which students acquire practical research experience and learn to work and think independently within a scientific environment. All students of the research master *Brain and Cognitive Sciences* conduct two research projects as mandatory parts of their curriculum:

*Research Project 1* (26 or 32 EC) and *Research Project 2* (36 or 42 EC).

---
Note for the reader: students from *Brain and Cognitive Sciences* form a multidisciplinary group and enter internships at a wide range of hosting institutes. Some of them could work at philosophy departments, others might deal with fMRI data analysis and again others would do their work at neurobiology labs. These different hosts will emphasize different skills, but all of them expose the students to the cycle of formulating a research question, gathering data, performing analysis and interpreting results to answer the research question.

## Learning objectives
During the research projects, the student is trained to:

1. Engage in the different phases of research in the field of brain and cognitive sciences (i.e. using and selecting relevant literature, choosing a research design, performing experimental work, analyzing data).

2. Independently perform relevant scientific research method(s) and data analyses.

3. Create a realistic planning for research, within the time limits that are imposed.

4. Write a scientific report about his/her research at an academic level.

5. Demonstrate academic presentation skills.

6. Demonstrate a scientific attitude (independence, responsibility, perseverance, initiative, self-assessment, communication) within the work and in relation to the supervisor and colleagues.

7. Reflect on and describe the limitations and implications of the research project.

## Roles within the project

To reach these goals, the student will work together with a daily supervisor, an internal assessor and an external assessor. 

The daily supervisor can be a PhD candidate or a more senior researcher who works in the hosting research group. The internal assessor should be a researcher within the hosting research group who has a doctoral degree. It is possible for a single person to have both the supervisor and  internal assessor role, as long as these requirements are met.

The external assessor should be a researcher from another group, who still has relevant expertise (whether topic-wise or method-wise) to assess the final report that is written on the project.

One of the assessors will be designated examiner, and will hold ultimate responsibility for the final grade. This examiner needs to be a UvA employee with a doctoral degree.

Table 1 summarizes the requirements and responsibilities of the different roles. Please note that the assessor tasks depend on whether the assessor is internal or external to the lab where the project is taking place. The tasks are described in more detail in the section [Detailed tasks per role](#detailed-tasks-per-role).

## Phases of the Research Project

The Research Project goes through several phases:

1. In the first month, the student registers the Research Project via www.datanose.nl/#yourprojects, reads relevant literature and formulates research questions, hypotheses and an appropriate design. This results in a Research Proposal, which the students submits via the online form at Datanose.nl within one month of registering  the project.

2. In the subsequent months, the student will acquire and/or analyze the data relevant to the Research Project. At some convenient time within this phase, the student will have a Midterm Evaluation to discuss progress and mutual satisfaction of the student and supervisor.
3. In the final month of the project (or earlier if the supervisor deems this appropriate), the student will draft a report on the conducted research, on which the supervisor provides feedback. This draft should be as definitive as possible, so that meaningful feedback can be given.

Based on the feedback on this draft, the student will submit a final version to Datanose.nl, which will be graded by both assessors. 

The student will also give an oral presentation about their Research Project, during a meeting at which at least the internal assessor is present, but preferably in front of the research group.

## Detailed tasks per role
### Supervisor tasks

#### Assist in project planning
When the student submits a research proposal to the programme, this will include planning for the project. This planning should be realistic and the workload should correspond to the EC count of the project. The supervisor is requested to ascertain the feasibility of the project within the submitted time frame. The student can inform the supervisor about the relevant EC count.

Project size (EC)| Workload (hours) | Fulltime equivalent
:----: | :----:|:----:|
26 | 728|17 weeks
32| 896|21 weeks
36|1008|24 weeks
42|1176|28 weeks

Once the proposal has been approved, it will not be possible to change the EC rewarded to the student upon succesful completion of the project.
#### Be contact for student questions
The supervisor is the go-to person for the student, for any question related to performing the research project. During the research project, the supervisor should be available to discuss problems within a reasonable time frame. When absent due to illness or leave, the supervisor should ensure that there is somebody else available for pressing questions of the student.

#### Provide feedback on overall performance and promotes scientific attitude.
The daily supervisor guides the student and provides constructive feedback on his or her performance, whether that's mastering techniques, understanding key concepts or other aspects of being a scientist. This feedback is important to improve the skills and knowledge of the student, and to foster an overall academic attitude.
#### Join midterm evaluation, together with student.
Halfway through the project, the student will schedule an evaluation meeting to discuss all progress so far, as well as performance and mutual satisfaction about the internship. This is an important opportunity for both parties to review how things are going.
#### Provide feedback on the draft version of the research report.
At the end of the project, the student will submit a draft version of the research report. This report should be written in the format of a research article that is appropriate to the field in which the internship takes place (e.g. following the guidelines of a key journal), and it should clearly convey the work that the student has done. The draft version should be as complete as possible, to allow for effective feedback.

The supervisor is expected to evaluate this draft report and provide the student with constructive feedback.

####  Evaluate experimental work and presentation
In case the supervisor and internal assessor are not the same person, the supervisor is strongly encouraged to *advise* the internal assessor on grading the experimental work of the student, as well as the oral presentation on the project. 

### Internal assessor tasks
#### Provide feedback on the draft version of the research report
At the end of the project, the student will submit a draft version of the research report. This report should be written in the format of a research article that is appropriate to the field in which the internship takes place (e.g. following the guidelines of a key journal), and it should clearly convey the work that the student has done. The draft version should be as complete as possible, to allow for effective feedback.

The internal assessor is expected to evaluate this draft report and provide the student with constructive feedback.

#### Grade experimental work, presentation and final report
The internal assessor is expected to grade all three assessment forms: the experimental work, the final presentation and the final report, using the Grading Rubrics appended to this manual. Experimental work can be difficult to assess for an internal assessor who did not supervise the student, which is why the supervisor is expected to provide the internal assessor with advice on the grading.

### External assessor tasks
#### Grade final report
The external assessor is expected to grade the final report, using the Grading Rubric appended to this manual.

### Examiner tasks
#### Submit the final grade.
The examiner is expected to submit the final grade to the programme via www.datanose.nl, using a link that is automatically e-mailed once the student has submitted the final report.

#### Guarantee validity of the grade.
The examiner is expected to collect the grade(s) given by the other assessor and to determine a final grade. This includes discussing the verdict with the other assessor, and reaching consensus if opinions about the final grade diverge too much.

### Student tasks
As a research master student, the student enrolled in either *Research Project 1* or *Research Project 2* is expected to take the lead on his or her project. While all decisions and plan should be made in collaboration with the supervisor, the student is expected to display ownership of the project. Expectations from the student are: 

 - The student formulates a clear research question
 -  The student develops and tests hypotheses that addresses the research question 
 - The student schedules work to meet important deadlines
 - The student collects and reads relevant literature 
 - The student writes and submits a Research Proposal to the programme within one month after registering the project 
 - The student gathers reliable and sufficient data for testing the hypotheses 
 - The student processes and analyzes the data critically, to answer the research question 
 - The student writes an original report, in line with academic standards, in the fashion of a
   research article from the respective field
  - The student presents and discusses the research project orally upon completion
  - The student takes initiative to make the project a success (i.e. identifying issues, troubleshooting, setting up necessary meetings, scheduling the Midterm Evaluation)

## Grading
Grading is based on three components: the experimental work, the final report on the project and the oral presentation on the project. Table 2 summarizes the different components, their contribution to the final grade and the minimum grade required per component.

| Component |Contribution to final grade| Assessed by| Minimum grade | 
|--|--|--|--|
|  |  | | |
